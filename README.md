In this repository, I analyze the price response functions of the NASDAQ TAQ
financial market data for the year 2008.

A research paper made using the code in this repository and published in The
European Journal of Physics B can be found [here](https://rdcu.be/cilHT). A
preprint version of the paper can be found
[here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.15105).


I reproduce in the
[taq_responses_physical](https://github.com/juanhenao21/financial_response_spread_year/tree/master/project/taq_responses_physical)
folder the sections 3.1 and 3.2 of the paper
[Cross-response in correlated financial markets: individual stocks](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1140/epjb/e2016-60818-y.pdf)
to obtain the midpoint prices, trade signs, self-responses, cross-responses,
trade sign self-correlators and trade sign cross-correlators values for
different stocks.

Based on these values, I analyzed the price response functions in trade and
physical time scale
([taq_responses_trade](https://github.com/juanhenao21/financial_response_spread_year/tree/master/project/taq_responses_trade/taq_algorithms),
[taq_responses_physical](https://github.com/juanhenao21/financial_response_spread_year/tree/master/project/taq_responses_phyisical/taq_algorithms))
and the influence of the number of trades in a second in the response functions
([taq_responses_activity](https://github.com/juanhenao21/financial_response_spread_year/tree/master/project/taq_responses_activity/taq_algorithms)).
I also analyze the influence of the time shift between trade signs and midpoint
prices
([taq_physical_shift](https://github.com/juanhenao21/financial_response_spread_year/tree/master/project/taq_physical_shift/taq_algorithms),
[taq_responses_physical_shift](https://github.com/juanhenao21/financial_response_spread_year/tree/master/project/taq_responses_physical_shift/taq_algorithms),
[taq_trade_shift](https://github.com/juanhenao21/financial_response_spread_year/tree/master/project/taq_trade_shift/taq_algorithms)
and
[taq_responses_trade_shift](https://github.com/juanhenao21/financial_response_spread_year/tree/master/project/taq_responses_trade_shift/taq_algorithms)),
the influence of the time lag
([taq_responses_physical_short_long](https://github.com/juanhenao21/financial_response_spread_year/tree/master/project/taq_responses_physical_short_long/taq_algorithms))
in the response functions in physical time scale and the impact of the spread
([taq_avg_responses_physical](https://github.com/juanhenao21/financial_response_spread_year/tree/master/project/taq_avg_responses_physical/taq_algorithms))
in the strength of the response functions in physical time scale.

You can find
[here](https://financial-response-spread-year.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
a detailed documentation of the code.

## Getting Started

The main code is implemented in `Python`. As we use the TAQ data format, it is
necessary to extract the data to a readable format. To do that, is used a `C++`
module, however, all this process is automated with `Python`.

If you are part of the AG Guhr and you are interested in test the code, you can
write me asking for some data files examples, so I can share the files with
you. Unfortunately, due to Copyright, I can not share the data files with
external people of the research group.

### Prerequisites

For `Python`, all the packages needed to run the analysis are in the
`requirements.txt` file.

For the `C++` module compilation I used the `g++` compiler. It is necessary to
install the `-lboost_date_time` and the `armadillo-3.920.3` module.

## Running the code

The first step is to clone the repository

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/juanhenao21/financial_response_spread_year.git
```

To install all the needed `Python` packages I recommend to create a virtual
environment and install them from the `requirements.txt` file. To install the
packages from terminal, you can use

```bash
$ virtualenv -p python3 env
$ source env/bin/activate
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### TAQ Responses Physical

After you clone the repository, you need to create two folders inside the
`financial_response_spread_year/project` folder, one folder with the name
`taq_data` and another folder with the name `taq_plot`. In these folders will
be saved the results of the analysis.

#### Start the analysis from scratch

To run the code from scratch and reproduce the results in section 2.3 and
2.4 of the
[paper](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1140/epjb/e2016-60818-y.pdf),
you need to copy the folder `decompress_original_data_2008` to the folder
`financial_response_spread_year/project/taq_data`.
Then you need to create a folder with the name `original_year_data_2008` inside
`financial_response_spread_year/project/taq_data` and move the `.quotes` and
`.trades` files of the tickers you want to analyze. Make sure you move a copy
of the files and not the originals, because when you run the code, it will
delete these files to free space.

Then, you need to move (cd) to the folder
`financial_response_spread_year/project/taq_responses_physical/taq_algorithms/`
and in the `main()` function of the module
`taq_data_main_responses_physical.py`, edit the tickers list with the stocks
you want to analyze (in this case the symbols of the files of the tickers you
copy in the previous step).

```Python
tickers = ['AAPL', 'MSFT']
```

Finally, you need to run the module. In Linux, using the terminal the command
looks like

```bash
$ python3 taq_data_main_responses_physical.py
```

The program will obtain and plot the data for the corresponding stocks.

#### Start the analysis with the year CSV data files

If you have the CSV data files, you need to create a folder with the name
`csv_year_data_2008` inside `financial_response_spread_year/project/taq_data`,
and move the CSV files inside.  Make sure you move a copy of the files and not
the originals, because when you run the code, it will delete these files to
free space. Then go to the
`financial_response_spread_year/project/taq_responses_physical/taq_algorithms/taq_data_main_responses_physical.py`
file and comment the line in the `main` function

```Python
# taq_build_from_scratch(tickers, year)
```

Edit the tickers list with the stocks you want to analyze (in this case the
symbols of the files of the tickers you copy in the previous step).

```Python
tickers = ['AAPL', 'MSFT']
```

Finally, you need to run the module. In Linux, using the terminal, the command
looks like

```bash
$ python3 taq_data_main_responses_physical.py
```

The program will obtain and plot the data for the corresponding stocks.

All the following analysis depend directly from the results of this section. If
you want to run them, you need to run this section first.

### TAQ Responses Trade

To run this part of the code, you need to move (cd) to the folder
`financial_response_spread_year/project/taq_responses_trade/taq_algorithms/`
and edit the tickers list with the stocks you want to analyze (in this case the
symbols of the files of the tickers you use in the previous section).

```Python
tickers = ['AAPL', 'MSFT']
```

Then you need to run the module `taq_data_main_responses_trade.py`. In Linux,
using the terminal the command looks like

```bash
$ python3 taq_data_main_responses_trade.py
```

This part of the code is the slowest due to a bad implementation. I do not
recommend to analyze several stocks in this time scale.

### TAQ Responses Activity

To run this part of the code, you need to move (cd) to the folder
`financial_response_spread_year/project/taq_responses_activity/taq_algorithms/`
and edit the tickers list with the stocks you want to analyze (in this case the
symbols of the files of the tickers you use in the TAQ Responses Physical
section).

```Python
tickers = ['AAPL', 'MSFT']
```

Then you need to run the module `taq_data_main_responses_activity.py`. In
Linux, using the terminal the command looks like

```bash
$ python3 taq_data_main_responses_activity.py
```

### TAQ Time Shift

The TAQ time shift analysis is divided in two time scales and in two modules.
The modules have to be executed in the order they appear in the explanation.

In both cases you need to edit the tickers list with the stocks you want to
analyze (in this case the symbols of the files of the tickers you use in the
previous sections).

```Python
tickers = ['AAPL', 'MSFT']
```

#### Physical time scale

To run this part of the code, you need to move (cd) to the folder
`financial_response_spread_year/project/taq_physical_shift/taq_algorithms/` and
run the module `taq_data_main_physical_shift.py`. In Linux, using the terminal
the command looks like

```bash
$ python3 taq_data_main_physical_shift.py
```

After you run the `taq_data_main_physical_shift.py` module, you can move (cd)
to the folder
`financial_response_spread_year/project/taq_responses_physical_shift/taq_algorithms/`
and run the module `taq_data_main_responses_physical_shift.py`. In Linux, using
the terminal the command looks like

```bash
$ python3 taq_data_main_responses_physical_shift.py
```

#### Trade time scale

To run this part of the code, you need to move (cd) to the folder
`financial_response_spread_year/project/taq_trade_shift/taq_algorithms/` and
run the module `taq_data_main_trade_shift.py`. In Linux, using the terminal the
command looks like

```bash
$ python3 taq_data_main_trade_shift.py
```

After you run the `taq_data_main_trade_shift.py` module, you can move (cd) to
the folder
`financial_response_spread_year/project/taq_responses_trade_shift/taq_algorithms/`
and run the module `taq_data_main_responses_trade_shift.py`. In Linux, using
the terminal the command looks like

```bash
$ python3 taq_data_main_responses_trade_shift.py
```

### TAQ Responses Short Long

To run this part of the code, you need to move (cd) to the folder
`financial_response_spread_year/project/taq_responses_physical_short_long/taq_algorithms/`
and edit the tickers list with the stocks you want to analyze (in this case the
symbols of the files of the tickers you use in the previous sections).

```Python
tickers = ['AAPL', 'MSFT']
```

Then you need to run the module
`taq_data_main_responses_physical_short_long.py`. In Linux, using the terminal
the command looks like

```bash
$ python3 taq_data_main_responses_physical_short_long.py
```

### TAQ Spread Impact

To run this part of the code, you need to move (cd) to the folder
`financial_response_spread_year/project/taq_avg_spread/taq_algorithms/`
and edit the tickers list with the stocks you want to analyze (in this case the
symbols of the files of the tickers you use in the previous sections).

```Python
tickers = ['AAPL', 'MSFT']
```

Then you need to run the module `taq_data_main_avg_spread.py`. In Linux, using
the terminal the command looks like

```bash
$ python3 taq_data_main_avg_spread.py
```

This analysis is recommended to be done with several stocks. The key point is
that all the stocks used have to have already the self-response function
analysis of the first part (TAQ Responses Physical).

After you run the `taq_data_main_avg_spread.py` module, you can move (cd) to
the folder
`financial_response_spread_year/project/taq_avg_responses_physical/taq_algorithms/`
and run the module `taq_data_main_avg_responses_physical.py`. In Linux, using
the terminal the command looks like

```bash
$ python3 taq_data_main_avg_responses_physical.py
```

## Expected results

A complete explanation of this work can be found in this
[paper](https://rdcu.be/cilHT). In general for the response functions, an
increase to a maximum followed by a slowly decrease is expected.

![Response functions](paper/financial_response_spread_year_paper/figures/03_responses_physical_scale_2008.png)

In the time shift analysis, a change in the relative position between returns
and trade signs can vanish the response function signal.

![Time shift](paper/financial_response_spread_year_paper/figures/04_shift_responses_physical.png)

Dividing the time lag used in the returns, we obtain a short and long
response function, where the short component has a large impact compared with
the long component.

![Short long](paper/financial_response_spread_year_paper/figures/05_short_long_GOOG_MA.png)

Finally, the spread directly impact the strength of the price response
functions. Liquid stocks have smaller price responses.
